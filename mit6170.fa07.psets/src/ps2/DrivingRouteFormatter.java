 *
 * <p>
 * Calling <tt>computeDirections</tt> should produce directions in the
 * following form:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <tt>
 * Turn right onto Baker Street and go 1.2 miles.<br> Turn slight left
 * onto MacGregor Street and go 0.8 miles.<br> Turn sharp right onto
 * Burton street and go 2.3 miles.<br> Continue onto Connor Street and
 * go 1.1 miles.<br>
 * </tt>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each line should correspond to a single geographic feature of the
 * route.  In the first line, "Baker Street" is the name of the first
 * geographical feature of the route, and "1.2 miles" is the length of
 * the geographic feature.  The length should be reported to
 * tenth-of-a-mile precision. Each line should be terminated by a
 * newline and should include no extra spaces other than those shown
 * above.

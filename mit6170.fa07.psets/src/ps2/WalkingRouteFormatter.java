/**
 * <p>
 * A WalkingRouteFormatter class knows how to create a textual
 * description of directions from one location to another suitable for
 * a pedestrian.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Calling <tt>computeDirections</tt> should produce directions in the
 * following form:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * Turn right onto Baker Street and walk for 20 minutes.
 * Turn slight left onto MacGregor Street and walk for 8 minutes.
 * Turn sharp right onto Burton street and walk for 3 minutes.
 * Continue onto Connor Street and walk for 12 minutes.
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each line should correspond to a single geographic feature of the
 * route.  In the first line, "Baker Street" is the name of the first
 * geographical feature of the route, and "20 minutes" is the length
 * of time that it would take to walk along the geographic feature,
 * assuming a walking speed of 20 minutes per mile.  The time in
 * minutes should be reported to the nearest minute. Each line should
 * be terminated by a newline and should include no extra spaces other
 * than those shown above.
